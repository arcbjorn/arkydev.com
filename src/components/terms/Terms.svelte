    </p>
    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may terminate your use of the Sites and Applications without cause or notice, which may
      result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with you. All
      provisions of this Agreement that by their nature should survive termination shall survive

      months, whereby your account may be charged up to 3-days before your "month anniversary") of your

      before it renews each year in order to avoid billing of the next year's membership fees to your
      Payment Method. Yearly renewals occur on the "month and day anniversary" (with the exception of
      shorter months, whereby your account may be charged up to 3-days before your "month and day anniversary")
      of your initial purchase date. We will bill the yearly membership fee to the Payment Method you
