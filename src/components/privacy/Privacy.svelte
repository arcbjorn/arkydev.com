        being used by you, to improve your experience on it and our Service offerings.

        We also have a legitimate interest in aggregating and/or anonymizing or de-identifying the

        When we process your Personal Data for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider
        and balance any potential impact on you, and your rights under data protection laws. Our
        legitimate business interests do not automatically override your interests – we will not use
        your Personal Data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you,
        unless we have your consent for our processing activities or those activities are otherwise
        required or permitted by law. You have right to object to processing that is based on our
        legitimate interests, as further described below.
      </li>

    <p>
      Subject to applicable law and reasonable steps that we may take to verify your identity with
      respect to your requests, you have the following rights in relation to your Personal Data:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Right of access: If you ask us, we will confirm whether we are processing your Personal Data
        and, if so, provide you with a copy of that Personal Data (along with certain other
        details). If you require additional copies, we may need to charge a reasonable fee.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right to rectification: If your Personal Data that we control is inaccurate or incomplete,
        you are entitled to have it rectified or completed. Note that we may not be able to rectify
        data obtained from a third party such as a governmental agency or other data that we do not
        control, and you will need to contact that third party directly. If we have shared your
        Personal Data with others, we will tell them about the rectification where possible. If you
        ask us, where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your
        Personal Data so that you can contact them directly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right to erasure: You may ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data and we will do so in
        some circumstances, such as where we no longer need it (we may not delete your data when
        other interests outweigh your right to deletion, for example if we are required by law to
        keep it). If we have shared your data with others, we will tell them about the erasure where
        possible. If you ask us, where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom
        we shared your Personal Data so that you can contact them directly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right to restrict processing: You may ask us to restrict or 'block' the processing of your
        Personal Data in certain circumstances, such as where you contest the accuracy of that
        Personal Data or object to us processing it. We will tell you before we lift any
        restrictions on processing. If we have shared your Personal Data with others, we will tell
        them about the restriction where possible. If you ask us, where possible and lawful to do
        so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your Personal Data so that you can contact
        them directly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right to data portability: Effective 25 May 2018, you have the right to obtain your Personal
        Data from us that you consented to give us or that is necessary to perform a contract with
        you, to the extent it is available. We will give you your Personal Data in a structured,
        commonly used and machine-readable format.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right to object: You may ask us at any time to stop processing your Personal Data, and we
        will do so if we are processing your Personal Data for the Services, for direct marketing,
        or otherwise. However, if we are relying on a legitimate interest to process your Personal
        Data and we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing we may continue; or
        you may exercise your rights by contacting us as indicated under "Contact Us". Note you will
        be asked to verify your identity when submitting a request.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling: You have the right to be free
        from decisions that we make based solely on automated processing of your Personal Data,
        including profiling, which produce a significant legal effect on you, unless such profiling
        is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between you and us, or
        with your explicit consent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right to withdraw consent: If we rely on your consent to process your Personal Data, you
        have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Your withdrawal of consent will not
        apply to or affect prior processing of data that was processed prior to our receipt of your
        withdrawal of consent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right to lodge a complaint with the data protection authority: If you have a concern about
        our privacy practices, including the way we have handled your Personal Data, you can report
        it to the data protection authority that is authorized to hear those concerns.
      </li>
    </ul>

      through account settings or features, or by deleting your account.

    <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>

    <p>
      {ECompanyName.ABBREVIATION} operates its site in the Georgia. If you are located in another jurisdiction,
      you are notified that your information will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United
      States.
    </p>

    <p>
      BY USING THIS SITE AND PROVIDING {ECompanyName.ABBREVIATION} WITH INFORMATION, YOU CONSENT TO THIS
      TRANSFER, PROCESSING AND STORAGE OF YOUR INFORMATION IN THE GEORGIA. If you do not consent to this,
      you should not use our Sites or Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is important to note that the privacy laws in the Georgia may not be as comprehensive as
      those in other countries such as the European Union. By consenting to our use of your Personal
      Data in accordance with this Policy, you accept the risk of your Personal Data being used
      under these less-comprehensive laws by {ECompanyName.ABBREVIATION} and our Partners and service
      providers.
    </p>
    <h2>Retention</h2>

    <p>
      {ECompanyName.ABBREVIATION} will retain Personal Data for the period necessary to provide our Services
      or for the purposes for which it was collected, or as otherwise required by our contracts or by
      law.
    </p>

    <p>
      When determining how long we should keep data, we consider the length of time we will have a
      relationship with you or our clients, and provide our Services, whether there is a legal
      obligation that would require us to keep the information for a specified period of time, the
      reasons why we process your data, the risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your
      Personal Data.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may also anonymize or de-identify Personal Data so it would no longer be associated with
      you and use such anonymized or de-identified data for research or analytical purposes. If data
      is anonymized or de-identified, we may use this data for as long as we have a legitimate
      business purpose for such use, without additional notice to you.
    </p>
    <h2>Children Under 16</h2>

    <p>
      Our Services and Sites are not directed at children under 16 years of age (or older where
      required by law), and we do not knowingly collect or receive Personal Data from them. If we
      learn that we have received Personal Data from a child whose age requires parental consent for
      processing, we will delete the data or only process the data under the supervision of a parent
      or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by our Terms of Service on behalf of the child. If
      you believe that we have received Personal Data from a child whose age requires parental
      consent, you may contact us at <a class="link" href={'mailto:' + ECompanyEmail.PRIVACY}
        >{ECompanyEmail.PRIVACY}</a
      >.
